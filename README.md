# GravitySimulation
This little script simulate the movement of stars interacting with each other following the Newton's laws of gravity.
The begining is a little slow but after a few second, the stars gain velocity and thus, show us the beautiful phenomenon of chaos.

At the beginning there is 1000 stars randomly placed. 
When two stars are too close they fusion in a bigger star.
When a star is too far away from the centre point it vanishes.
The camera is always centered in the center of mass of all the stars.
